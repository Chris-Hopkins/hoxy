<h2 id="response-population" data-tldr="Suppressing server calls.">Response population</h2>

<p>
  Hoxy normally populates responses by sending the request to the destination server during the normal request/response lifecycle.
  Alternatively, if you modify any aspect of the response before this happens (i.e. during the <code>request</code> phase) hoxy treats the <em>entire</em> response as populated, and skips the call to the destination server.
  If you modify any aspect of the response after this happens  (i.e. during the <code>response</code> phase) it overwrites just that aspect of the response from the server.
</p>

<pre class="language-javascript code">
  proxy.intercept('request', function(req, resp, cycle) {
    response.string = 'Hello';
    // The response is now populated so the
    // server call is skipped. Status code will
    // default to 200.
  });
</pre>

<pre class="language-javascript code">
  proxy.intercept('request', function(req, resp, cycle) {
    response.statusCode = 200;
    // The response is now populated so the
    // server call is skipped. Response body
    // defaults to empty.
  });
</pre>

<pre class="language-javascript code">
  proxy.intercept('response', function(req, resp, cycle) {
    response.string = 'Hello';
    // The response was already populated,
    // we just overwrite its body. Status
    // code remains the same.
  });
</pre>

<pre class="language-javascript code">
  proxy.intercept('response', function(req, resp, cycle) {
    response.statusCode = 666;
    // The response was already populated,
    // we just overwrote the status. I

<h2 id="change-accumulation" data-tldr="Behavior over sequential handlers.">Change accumulation</h2>

<p>
  Changes to requests and responses are cumulative over the whole request/response cycle.

<h2 id="https-proxying" data-tldr="How HTTPS proxying works">HTTPS Proxying</h2>

<p>
How does HTTPS proxying work in Hoxy?
First, let's review how HTTPS proxying works in general.
Suppose you want to insert a proxy between yourself and the website <em>https://example.com</em>.
There are two ways to do this: direct and reverse proxying.
</p>

<h3 id="direct-https-proxying">Direct HTTPS proxying</h3>

<p>
To set up a direct HTTPS proxy, you'd launch a proxy on port 8080 and set your browser to do HTTPS proxying through <code>localhost:8080</code>, then visit the site directly from your browser.
What happens here differs radically from HTTP proxying.
During HTTP proxying, the client sends this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
  GET http://www.example.com/foo.html HTTP/1.1
</pre>

<p>
In English this means <em>go to example.com and get /foo.html for me.</em>
But during HTTPS proxying, the client sends this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
  CONNECT example.com:443 HTTP/1.1
</pre>

<p>
Which in English means <em>connect me to example.com, I want to have a private conversation with them.</em>
Once the proxy establishes the pipe, the client TLS-handshakes the server on that connection.
Then, it sends normal HTTP traffic over it like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
  GET /foo.html HTTP/1.1
</pre>

<p>
...but it's encrypted, so the proxy can't see it.
Anything might be happening on that connection, from the proxy's POV.
</p>

<p>
This is formally known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_tunneling">HTTP CONNECT tunneling</a>.
Since the proxy isn't privy to the conversation, there's no need for it to be an HTTPS server itself, even though "https://" appears in the browser's URL bar.
Its job is just to shovel TCP packets back and forth, which happen to contain undecypherable TLS traffic.
</p>

<h3 id="reverse-https-proxying">Reverse HTTPS proxying</h3>

<p>
A reverse HTTPS proxy is a different animal altogether.
To set it up, you'd launch a proxy on port 8080.
Since this is a reverse HTTPS proxy, you'll need a few more startup options:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>A private key.</li>
  <li>A certificate signed by the above key, with <code>CN=localhost</code>.</li>
  <li>The reverse proxy target, consisting of <code>"https://example.com"</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The key and the cert in particular are necessary because a reverse proxy—from the client's POV—isn't a proxy at all, but an HTTPS webserver that speaks TLS.
And because of the constraints of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">PKI</a>, the client needs to trust the cert provided above.
So one of two things needs to happen:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The cert needs to be signed by a known CA, which requires giving somebody money.</li>
  <li>You must self-sign your own CA, make your client trust it, and sign the above cert with it.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Either way you'll end up with a signed, trusted cert and your reverse proxy should work.
</p>

<h3 id="hoxy-https-proxying">So how does Hoxy figure into this?</h3>

<p>
Hoxy follows these patterns, but with one major deviation having to do with direct proxying and HTTPS CONNECT tunneling.
Instead of connecting the client to the remote server, Hoxy connects the client to its own private HTTPS server.
This is a separate server instance from the proxy itself and solely exists to spoof TLS.
</p>

<p>
Normally, the client would immediately realize something fishy is going on.
The spoofing server, being TLS, has provided a cert to the client that hasn't been signed by a client-trusted CA.
Thus, to use Hoxy as an HTTPS direct proxy, you must create your <em>own</em> self-signed root CA, make your client trust it, then pass it to Hoxy as a startup option.
</p>

<p>
With this in mind, let's rewind to just before the client realizes something fishy is going on.
Hoxy, having in its possession both the cert AND the private key of a client-trusted CA, will use it to generate <em>spoofed</em> keys and certs, signed by that CA, for each HTTPS domain the client visits.
From the client's POV now, nothing fishy is going on.
As far as it knows, its CONNECT requests are being honored by the proxy, and it's talking directly to the remote website in a private channel.
</p>

<p>
But in reality, the client is tunneling to an imposter server, its traffic is being decrypted and intercepted, then being re-encrypted and sent onward.
Neither the client nor the server are the wiser.
</p>

<h3 id="tls-certauthority-diff">"tls" versus "certAuthority"</h3>

<p>
You may have noticed there are two key/cert options that can be passed to Hoxy, with different names: <code>tls</code> and <code>certAuthority</code>.
It should now make sense why.
The former is for reverse proxying, and is just Node's config option for running an HTTPS webserver.
The latter is for direct proxying.
It's a meta-key/cert combo, used to spoof <em>actual</em> key/cert combos on the fly.
Incidentally, these two options are mutually exclusive.
It wouldn't make sense to use both at the same time.
