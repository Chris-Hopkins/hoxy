<p>
  Hoxy is an HTTP hacking tool for JavaScript programmers.
  It operates in the same general space as Charles or Fiddler, but rather than having a GUI, it exposes a programming API for tampering with HTTP traffic.
  A few key features:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Manipulate request and response bodies as jQuery or JSON objects.</li>
  <li>Inspect and manipulate URLs, headers, status codes, etc.</li>
  <li>Support for direct and reverse proxying over both HTTP and HTTPS.</li>
  <li>Simulate latency and low-bandwidth connections.</li>
  <li>Overlay local filesystems over remote ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  With a little imagination, the possibilities are limitless.
  But to get you started, here a few ideas for things you could do.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Replace your Facebook frineds with pictures of unicorns.</li>
  <li>Add bizarre HTTP request headers to confuse server admins.</li>
  <li>Strip ads from web pages for personal browsing.</li>
  <li>Fuzz test your site's load sequence by adding random amounts of latency.</li>
  <li>Test JavaScript changes in production, without pushing code to production.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  These docs are for Hoxy 3.x.
  See the <a href="#examples">incantations</a> section for code samples.
</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>
  Hoxy functions as a normal proxy standing between the client and server.
  You intercept traffic during either the request or response phase, or both.
  The <a href="#phase-lifecycle">phase lifecycle section</a> contains a more complete description, but here's a simplified illustration.
</p>

<pre class="code">
  time ==>
  -----------------------
  server:       3
  -------------/-\-------
  hoxy:       2   4
  -----------/-----\-----
  client:   1       5
</pre>

<ol>
  <li>Client sends request.</li>
  <li>Hoxy intercepts the request.</li>
  <li>Server receives request and sends response.</li>
  <li>Hoxy intercepts the response.</li>
  <li>Client receives response.</li>
</ol>
